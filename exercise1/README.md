# How to use the front/backend aplications

- Initialize Rails app from the `backend/` using:
```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
```

- Then, initialize the frontend app from `frontend/` using:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

**Remember!**
The frontend app uses React! It's required to have Node@14 and yarn installed and configured.
